                </h3>
                <p>
                  Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ('DNT') feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy
                  preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing
                  DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to
                  be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy
                  Notice.
